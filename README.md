## Requirements

Tested on the following operating systems/architectures:

* CentOS 7 and 8 (x86_64)
* Ubuntu 18.04LTS or 20.04LTS (x86_64, aarch64/arm64 for Raspberry)
* Debian 10 "Buster" (x86_64, aarch64/arm64)
* Raspbian 10 (64 bit)

## Recommendations

* RAM: At least 1.5GB RAM, as less than this can result in out-of-memory failures.
* x2 CPUs are recommended

## Installation

You can first download the script to inspect it before running it, or run it directly:

```sh
sudo bash -c "bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/hornet-playbook/main/fullnode_install.sh)"
```

This pulls the installation file from the root of this repository and executes it.

The installation will:

* Install latest Hornet and start it up.
* Configure basic security (firewalls) and open all required ports for Hornet to operate.
* Install nginx as a reverse proxy to access Hornet's Dashboard.
* Add some helpful tools, e.g.: `horc` and `nbctl`.

### For Development

If you are working on a fork in a feature branch or happen to directly contribute to this repository you can run the installer pointing it to the appropriate branch, e.g.:
```sh
BRANCH="dev-branch"; GIT_OPTIONS="-b $BRANCH" bash <(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/hornet-playbook/$BRANCH/fullnode_install.sh")
```

To update the playbook to use a different hornet tag/version, for example hornet prerelease version `v0.4.0-rc2`:
```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -v -e hornet_version=v0.4.0-rc2 -e overwrite=yes
```
Note that a Hornet prerelease might require changes on the playbook's code.

## Docker Usage Commands

These are just a few helpful commands to help you find your way around docker:

### Docker Images

List all images
```sh
docker images
```
The output will look something like:
```sh
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
gohornet/hornet      v0.2.1              c97cba628d38        2 hours ago         90.4MB
<none>              <none>              b7b60a909a8f        2 hours ago         1.01GB
golang              1.13                a1072a078890        8 days ago          803MB
certbot/certbot     latest              3b7ec24cacc3        11 days ago         148MB
nginx               latest              231d40e811cd        3 weeks ago         126MB
alpine              latest              965ea09ff2eb        7 weeks ago         5.55MB
```

Note that an image consists of a "REPOSITORY" name and a "TAG".

Images with `<node>` are "dangling" images that have been used for building a docker image (you can use `horc` to cleanup unused images).

Delete a certain image using the image's ID. Images can also be referenced by the image's repository:tag as syntax, e.g. `nginx:latest`:
```sh
docker rmi 231d40e811cd
```

## View Docker Containers

View all docker containers:
```sh
docker ps -a
```
## Hornet Help Output
Run hornet with `--help`: given that we know the image's name and the tag. A quick way to get the tag variable configured:
```sh
docker run --rm -it gohornet/hornet:v0.2.1 --help
```

You can get the tag by viewing all images, or check the configuration file to see what is the currently used TAG:

On CentOS:
```sh
grep ^TAG /etc/sysconfig/hornet
```

On Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian:
```sh
grep ^TAG /etc/default/hornet
```

## Configuration

In the file below we can specify the image and tag to use. In addition we can configure which command line arguments to pass to hornet:

* On Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian: `/etc/default/hornet`

* On CentOS: `/etc/sysconfig/hornet`

## Control Hornet

Hornet app start:
```sh
systemctl start hornet
```
You can also replace `start` with `stop` or `restart`.

Hornet logs follow:

```sh
journalctl -u hornet -e -f
```
(omit the `-f` for not to follow the logs "live")

## Hornet Controller App

A GUI utility has been added to help manage some basics like controlling the server, viewing logs, upgrading hornet etc.

Make sure you are root (`sudo su`) and run:
```sh
horc
```

## Hornet Dashboard

Point your browser to your host's IP address or fully qualified domain name, e.g.:
```sh
https://my-node.io
```
Note that if you haven't configured the HTTPS certificate via `horc` you will get a warning about a self-signed certificate being used.

The first time you connect you'll have to entre the username and password you've configured during the installation. **However** there's one more "dashboard" to login to for which you should just use the same credentials.

### Enable Initial Login Prompt to Dashboard
By default anyone can access the node's dashboard with limited access. To disable that, a user/password login prompt can be enabled with the following steps:

```sh
cd /opt/hornet-playbook && git pull && grep "^dashboard_auth_basic_enabled: true" group_vars/all/z-installer-override.yml || echo "dashboard_auth_basic_enabled: true" >> group_vars/all/z-installer-override.yml
```
Then run:
```sh
run-playbook --tags=nginx_role
```

## Overwrite Hornet Config

It is possible to edit `/var/lib/hornet/config.json` manually and restart HORNET to apply the changes. Re-running the playbook will not overwrite your changes by default.

The recommended way to configure the file without having to worry about it getting overwritten is by copying the variables file to a new overwrite file.

Copy the config variables file to a new file:
```sh
cp /opt/hornet-playbook/group_vars/all/hornet-config-file.yml /opt/hornet-playbook/group_vars/all/z-append.yml
```
Edit the `/opt/hornet-playbook/group_vars/all/z-append.yml` as required (using nano, vi or your preferred editor). The variable names are similar to how you'd read the `config.json`. For example `hornet_config_snapshots_local_downloadURLs` corresponds to `snapshots.local.downloadURLs` in `config.json`. If you want to see the actual mapping you can view the template file in `/opt/hornet-playbook/roles/hornet/templates/config.json.j2`.

Then re-run the playbook while tagging the task to update the configuration file. Any variables you have overwritten and modified in `z-append.yml` will be applied and take precedence.
```sh
cd /opt/hornet-playbook && sudo ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -v --tags=hornet_config_file -e overwrite=yes
```

## Hornet HTTPS

When you access your node via its IP address you will likely get a warning from the browser about the site not being secure or certificate invalid for the domain. The reason is that a self-signed certificate has been generated for the node during the installation.

Some browsers should allow you to bypass the warning (`advanced` -> `proceed`). Some browsers may not allow this (e.g. Chrome or Brave on Mac).

You can get a domain name to point to your node's IP. In that case you can use `horc` to request a certificate for your domain. Then you'll be able to access the node using that domain name and the certificate will be approved.

**HTTPS Certificate**

Via `horc` (run on the command line) it is possible to request and enable HTTPS certificate for the node.

Note that you must already have a fully qualified domain name A record pointing to your server's IP.

Enabling a certificate will allow you to connect to your node with IOTA's official wallet.

## Ports

Below is a list of ports and URL paths configured by the playbook by default. External communication goes via `nginx` acting as a reverse proxy. The internal ports are not accessible externally.

NAME               | PORT INTERNAL | PORT EXTERNAL | PROTOCOL | URL PATH       | DESCRIPTION
-------------------|---------------|---------------|----------|----------------|-----------------------------
Dashboard          | 8087          | 443           | HTTPS    | /              | Main dashboard
Hornet API         | 14265         | 443           | HTTPS    | /api           | Used for wallet/API calls
Hornet peering     | 15600         | 15600         | TCP      | not applicable | Main peering port
Grafana            | 3000          | 443           | HTTPS    | /grafana       | Grafana monitoring /grafana
Prometheus         | 9090          | 443           | HTTPS    | /prometheus    | Prometheus metrics
Alertmanager       | 9093          | 443           | HTTPS    | /alertmanager  | Alertmanager for prometheus

All the external ports have been made accessible in the firewall. There is no need to configure the firewall on the node.

### Forward Ports

If you are running the node in an internal network/lan you have to forward at least the following ports from the router to the node:

Ports: 80/tcp (for certificate verification/enabling HTTPS), 443/tcp and 15600/tcp

## Peers

Peers can be added via:

* Hornet's dashboard (Note: this will be possible once [this Hornet github issue](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet/issues/1072) will be resolved.
* via `horc` tool available on the node cli
* nbctl (see below) a cli tool

### nbctl

You will find that the tool `nbctl` was installed on your node. Using this tool you can manage peers from the command line. See examples below:

Add a peer with alias:
```sh
nbctl -a -p /dns/node01.iota.io/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KzzWDLS1c1O6AaZlf8oipHnJb1361SoYMdh9S1T2Jz7lDd5P,alias/my_friend
```

Remove a peer:
```sh
nbctl -r -p 12D3KzzWDLS1c1O6AaZlf8oipHnJb1361SoYMdh9S1T2Jz7lDd5P
# or
nbctl -r -p /dns/node01.iota.io/tcp/15600/p2p/12D3KzzWDLS1c1O6AaZlf8oipHnJb1361SoYMdh9S1T2Jz7lDd5P,alias/my_friend
```

List peers:
```sh
nbctl -l
```

List peers with shorter output:
```sh
nbctl -s
```

## Monitoring

If you have monitoring enabled you can point your browser to `https://your-ip-or-domain/grafana`. That will open Grafana where some monitoring dashboards are available.

Monitoring applications (e.g. node-exporter, prometheus, etc) and dashboards can be upgraded using the command:
```sh
cd /opt/hornet-playbook && ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml -v --tags=monitoring_role
```

## Security

### Node Security
Security should not be taken lightly. It is recommended to take several steps to improve how you interact and authenticate with your server.

Please follow [this guide](https://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/securityhardening.html), it works for any Linux server.

### Get JWT Token
If you've enabled JWT token access for the REST API you can get a valid token by running the following command. Note that it needs to stop Hornet to obtain the token. It will start it up again once it is done:

```sh
systemctl stop hornet && docker run -u 39999:39999 --rm -it -v /var/lib/hornet/p2p:/app/p2p gohornet/hornet:1.0.2 --p2p.peerStore.path=/app/p2p/store tool jwt-api && systemctl start hornet
```
Make sure to use the right hornet version on the image tag above (`gohornet/hornet:1.0.2`)


## Troubleshooting

If something isn't working as expected, try to gather as much data as possible, as this can help someone who is able to help you finding out the cause of the issue.

If anything is wrong related to Hornet, first thing to look at are Hornet's logs. See how to get logs in [Control Hornet](#control-hornet) chapter.

To check if Hornet's API port is listening you can use the command to see if any output:
```sh
sudo lsof -Pni:14265
```
Note that after restarting Hornet it takes it some time to make the port available (e.g. when loading snapshot file).

### 502 Bad Gateway

If you receive this error when trying to browse to the dashboard then:

* nginx (the webserver/proxy) is working properly
* the back-end to which it is trying to connect isn't working properly.

Nginx takes requests from the web and forwards those internally. For example, `https://my-site.io` tells nginx to connect to Hornet's dashboard. If Hornet is inactive (crashed? starting up?) then nginx would not be able to forward your requests to it. Make sure Hornet is working properly, e.g. checking logs: see [Control Hornet](#control-hornet). Note that when checking the logs, start from the bottom of the logs and scroll up to the line where you see the error began.

### Hornet Does Not Startup

There are too many reasons and possibilities why this could happen. As stated above, check hornet logs: see [Control Hornet](#control-hornet).

Some of the most common reasons are:

* `no space left on device` - Your storage has been used up completely. Try to download a new DB via `horc`, this will delete the existing one. This is often the problem. Note that you might want to lower the DB Max Size via `horc` to match your storage.

* `panic: unable to initialize data store for peer store: Value log truncate required to run DB. This might result in data loss` - If your node crashed there might be corruption in the node's ID store DB. The way to fix this is by deleting it: `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/hornet/p2p/store` and starting up hornet.

### Connection not Private

You will probably get this message when trying to connect to the dashboard using your IP address.

Other messages might claim certificate is invalid for the domain.

You can safely proceed (most browsers allow to bypass the warning). And please read [Hornet HTTPS](#hornet-https)

### DB Corruption

If Hornet wasn't shut down properly there is a good chance that the DB is corrupted and you will have to remove it and start all over again.


### Logs
In the following link you can read more about how to collect logs from your system. Although this documentation is for IRI, the commands are similar (just replace iri with hornet if needed):

https://iri-playbook.readthedocs.io/en/master/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting

### Rerun Playbook

You can rerun the playbook to fix most issues. Use the tool `horc`, there's an option to rerun the playbook.

If `horc` isn't working, try the following command:

```sh
cd /opt/hornet-playbook && git pull && ansible-playbook -v site.yml -i inventory -e overwrite=yes
```
This command will reset all configuration files but also make a backup of existing ones so you'll be able to restore any previous peers and settings you had.

### Grafana Dashboards Missing

If you've opened Grafana for the first time and don't see any dashboards listed on the upper-left corner (Home) then you might have to restart Grafana. Simply run:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

## Appendix

### Hornet Plugins

Some of Hornet's plugins can be enabled and disabled using the `horc` tool via the menu.


## Known Issues

* Due to the rapid development and changes to Hornet, the configuration file can break the existing configuration when upgrading.
